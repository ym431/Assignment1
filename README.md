# The World of Venmo
---
## *Overview and Origin*

Venmo is a service that enables you to make payments and money requests to friends. It has become one of the most popular apps for *electronically transferring funds* from one party to another. Basically, Venmo offers a more social approach to paying those you owe by combining regular money transfer features with social media elements.
The company was created by Iqram Magdon-Ismail and Andrew Kortina, former roommates at UPenn. It began with the formation of a Frozen Yogurt shop in need of immediate materials via text message. In 2010, they raised $1.2 million of seed money, then bought by Braintree (FinTech payments company). Currently, the company is under PayPal (2012).

Because of Venmo’s technological nature, the business had a substantial amount of appeal to the youth, the more tech-savvy generation. However, the company can be utilized by quite literally anyone who is in need of paying money.

Venmo offers a debit card, in partnership with MasterCard. Through this, users can make payments anywhere in the US that accepts MasterCard with their Venmo balance. In 2020, it launched its own credit card, the Venmo Visa Credit Card.

Currently, the company is utilizing wire transfers, crypto, big data, mobile infrastructure, and physically mobile phones/anything with access to the internet.

## *Landscape: Payments and Billing*
From business not hiring, the FFR = 0, to high unemployment rates, 2009 was a tragic year in the overall business world. Seedrs CEO Jeff Kelisky spoke about the plethora of innovators and entrepreneurs who took this turmoil and turned it into the future. With the start of Venmo and other payment companies, 

> “We’ve watched shifts in customer behavior, shifts in compliance rules…the introduction of cryptocurrencies and the race to move money faster,” - Nan Siler, head of payment and financial operations at Kabbage.


The payment industry has skyrocketed as more and more users are getting involved in the simplicity of money transfers. Some of Venmo's major competitiors are Google Pay, Square, Apple Pay, Amazon, Zelle, and Western Union.

## *Results*
A key feature of this business is the social platform. Whenever one makes a payment, the transaction is posted for the public to see. These interactions give the users a sense of creative freedom when it comes to the messages they can write alongside their transactions. 
The two major downsides to this are: each party needs an account and a privacy/security issue.

**Venmo Business Model:**
Unlike companies who charge their users for sending/receiving payments or incorporate monthly fees, Venmo generates revenue through its interchange and withdrawal fees, interest on cash, fees for cashing checks, Pay with Venmo, and affiliate commissions on its cash back program.

## *Recommendations*
One of the main reasons customers tend to download the competitor app, Zelle, is because the money that is transferred directly enters the user’s bank account, rather than entering a medium. If Venmo offered a way to do that as well without assessing an additional fee, more people would prefer this app. This would include a different take on wire transfers, by diminishing the middle man.
